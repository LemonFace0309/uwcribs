# UW Cribs

**Description**:  Finding and selling short term rentals is a universal pain amongst postsecondary students. This repository contains the code for UW Cribs, a product serving the Waterloo postsecondary student community by providing a centralized filterable interface for housing posts made on Facebook groups. This project is still in its infancy but we hope from Day One to provide an enjoyable experience for students finding housing.

  - **Technology stack**: This repository contains code for a Turborepo monorepo, using Yarn as a package manager. It contains both `apps` and `packages`:
  * `apps`
    * `web`
      * A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web application written in TypeScript. It serves as the user-facing frontend interface allowing users to filter through housing posts.
    * `server`
      * A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server written in TypeScript. It serves as an API queried by the `web` app, performing CRUD operations on housing data.
    * `parser`
      * A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server written in JavaScript. It serves as a web scraper + data analyzer, scraping posts off of Facebook groups, categorizing posts into various data fields using `nlp.js`, and performing the appropriate CRUD operations on housing data.
  * `packages`
    * `ui`
      * A custom React UI library providing reusable components for the frontend applications of the monorepo.
    * `config`
      * Contains configuration files for various tools used in the monorepo, such as Jest, ESLint, and TailwindCSS.
    * `tsconfig`
      * Contains configuration files for using TypeScript in the applications written in TypeScript
